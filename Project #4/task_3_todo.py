Task 3: Health Advisor & Feedback Generator
📌 Goal: Give user-specific feedback based on their net calorie score

✅ What to do:
1. Define a global variable `daily_status` outside the function.

2. Define a function `generate_feedback(net_calories)` that:
   - Uses conditional statements to classify the net calories:
     - Net < -500: "🔥 Super active! Eat more."
     - -500 ≤ Net ≤ 500: "✅ Balanced day!"
     - Net > 500: "⚠️ Calorie surplus. Consider exercising."

   - Updates the global `daily_status` variable with the selected message.
   - Returns the message.

# Example placeholder:
# daily_status = ""
# def generate_feedback(net_calories):
#     # TODO: Use conditionals and set daily_status
